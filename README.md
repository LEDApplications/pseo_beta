# PSEO_Beta

Post-Secondary Employment Outcomes (PSEO) are experimental tabulations developed by the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program at the U.S. Census Bureau. PSEO data provide earnings and employment outcomes for college and university graduates by degree level, degree major, and post-secondary institution. These statistics are generated by matching university transcript data with a national database of jobs, using state-of-the-art confidentiality protection mechanisms to protect the underlying data.

This widget allows for exploration of the PSEO experimental tabulations. The current version only displays data for baccalaureate degree holders. Data on workers with  higher educational attainment is available in the raw files.
